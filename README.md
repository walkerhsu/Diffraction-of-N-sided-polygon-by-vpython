Diffraction of N-sided polygon

We created a model that can simulate the light diffraction of different sided polygon.

## UI

There are several buttons and a bar to select the medium, shape, and the number of edges of a polygen.

### medium 

We add three different mediums to select( air, water, glass), with refractive index being 1, 1.33, 1.55 respectively.

### shapes 

We create three classes of shapes( circle, rectangle, polygen). 

The polygen one can select the number of edges of a polygen by a selecting bar.
